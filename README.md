# Remote-SDR
Remote-SDR remotely controls a SDR receiver and a SDR transmitter from a web browser. Pre-configured for the QO-100 Es'Hail 2 satellite transponder. Can be used for any NBFM or SSB Radio from 1MHz up to 6 GHz. It can works in full duplex with Adalm-Pluto SDR, HackRF One, RTL-SDR or SA818.
Signal processing is done using gnuradio-companion and javascript. It runs on 1 or 2 Orange Pi One Plus single board computers under Armbian operating system to drive the SDRs. It runs also now on an Orange Pi Zero 2 with Armbian (Bullseye). It runs since version 2.4 on Raspberry 4 using Rasperry Pi OS.

Release v2.4 introduces the radio processing with a Raspberry Pi 4B.

Release 2.5 offers the processing of 2 HackRF One (TX and RX) by the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Release V3.0 introduces the Debian (Bullseye) operating system , GNU Radio 3.8 and an interface to Gpredict.
